# Full Implementation

## Audit Logs (ADMIN)

### Audit logs management

1. Admin must be able to observe actions, done to all entities within DB:
    1. Compare previous and new version of entity;
    2. See, if action was DELETE, UPDATE or INSERT;
    3. See, what user performed an action;
    4. See, when the action was performed.
2. Audit logs must be filterable by actioned entity.
