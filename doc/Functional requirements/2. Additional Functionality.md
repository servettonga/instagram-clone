## Profile Configurations

Profile configurations are managed from ADMIN side, can be turned ON/OFF from USER side.

> ⚠️
>
> Profile configurations are applicable as feature flags within CODE. That means, if there is no particular profile configuration stored within Database, then some code fragments within server application will never be executed or will never be missed, as:

NO PROFILE CONFIGURATION IN DB ⇒ NO VALUE FOR PARTICULAR PROFILE CONFIGURATION IS FOUND ⇒ NO ACTIONS ARE PERFORMED TO BLOCK/ALLOW SOME ACTION WITHIN CODE

### USER role user side

1. User must be able to observe profile configs as a list of inputs;
2. Configurations:
    1. Each type of notification (both email and in app) must be configurable;
3. User must be able to toggle ON/OFF all configs.

### ADMIN role user side

1. Admin must be able to observe list of all possible profile configurations;
2. Admin must be able to create new configurations, making them visible on USER role user profile settings page;
3. Admin must be able to disable profile configurations:
    1. Making profile configuration disabled makes it’s not applicable within code, hidden for all USER role users;
    2. For example, all profile configurations, set to OFF by USER role user, are no longer applicable:
        1. Profile configuration for sending email notifications for *another person following RECEIVER* is disabled by ADMIN =

        means notification RECEIVER can’t disable them =

        means they are always sent to RECEIVER.

4. Admin must be able to delete profile configurations.
